FuriousBirdsMilestone2
by Kaivan and Vismay
======================

Run the project by opening up birds.pro in QT and pressing 'run'.

Things that are NOT completely working:
 - finite friction does not work completely. We checked out constraint matrices again, but that doesn't seem to be the problem. The objects tend to veer left or right instead of rolling forwards after hitting the ground

Extra Credit:
 - changed the colors for the objects
 - implemented a Game Mode
	-Click the game mode button to start
	-During game mode, you cannot move around. You can only rotate the camera
	-A "target" sphere will initialize randomly (within 20-90 units)
	-Hit the target sphere by firing an object at it 
	-If you hit it, then the "target" will respawn
	-If you miss, when your object goes farther than 100 units, it will dissapear
